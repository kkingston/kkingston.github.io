### As usual, entering project mode at full speed, full confidence, only to be greeted with an ugly monster of misunderstanding.

You think you know, and you think you understand.  You do all the modules, readings, and lessons as you're supposed to.  Swimming along accross a very very deep sea, thinking your doing great. You're not out of breath, your muscles seem fine.  You'll make it to shore in no time.  Until you meet face to face with Nessie.. the Lochness Monster.  Possiby your ultimate doom...

As a beginner, you can see that Sinatra is a wonderful tool to add to your tool belt so far.  This the most abstracted project we've encountered in our journey yet, and it's so much cleaner than previous things we've worked on.  Seems easy enough.  Stringing together all of the things we've learned to date, and putting them together in a way that's proving your understanding. 

Being able to create dynamic routes that helps our app flow better, especially comparing to my experience creating webpages with pure HTML and CSS, this whole thing was mind blowing and exciting.  I flew through lessons, was thinking these concepts were so easy... 

I have two friends from my cohort, and we work together a lot!  Cheering eachother on, attempting to solve our problems together, sending new articles and videos to eachother, it's really great! We all were slammed with problem after problem, and all of us were having our own moments of doubt.. lack of motivation, wondering "Whyyyyyyy in God's name did we even start this program???!!!"

This was our turning point.  We needed to learn how to problem solve better.  

# I googled how to google better. 
**Seems stange.. but, it's possibly one of the best google searches I have ever made.


*"Let's solve your problems,like we solve a coding problem."*

What does it mean to solve your problems like a coding problem?? I can't figure out my coding problem.. that's why I'm googling "How to google".. It's all a big mess..

Well, if you have a big mess then you just need to seperate things out a bit.  Break it down.

**1. What's your problem?  

Maybe there are multiple mini problems causing this big problem.  
Write it down and keep asking: "What is the problem?"  Make a list of all these problems. 
I learned, that actually the more problems you have the better.

"But, Why?? I thought one problem means there's less work to do"  Said the person who is lazy, and just wants to finish their project faster..... 

We are beginners, so the more problems we have that means we have more angles to work from.  More perspectives and dots to connect to create a full picture.  Also, the more problems we are facing the more room to learn we have.  Another "What Not To Do" leaf added to our book of learning.

Learn to be happy when your errors start changing.  That usually means you're on the right track.

What is your error?  Read all of it, if you don't get it or understand the terminology pop it in google (just omit personal information, this isn't relevant to the google seach, and may make your results a little confusing)
Chances are someone had also had the same error at some point.  Maybe this problem will be solved here, and maybe this will just open a new door for the next step.

If you're thinking there's something wrong with your logic or syntax then write it out.  Grab a paper and hand write everything. Keep hand writing your possible changes you'd like to implement, then re type it into your code editior.  Maybe you only had a simple syntax error, maybe you mixed up your "get methods" vs your "post methods."  Who knows.. but some times translating from the computer to paper can help organize your thoughts and see what you're really thinking, and help you to verbalize what your problems are.


**2.  Start your search.

An empty search bar can be intimidating.  Like when a painter is looking at a blank canvas. "What do I do now?"

First off search often, search everything. Especially when you're new.  Only half confident in your thoughts?  Search it to give you that boost of reassurance.

***Here are some google searching tips and tricks that I've found helpful:***

Be concise and know what your keywords or phrases are. This is important.  Highlighting the keywords and skipping all the extra nonsense that doesn't contribute to a good search result, this will help better results filter to the top of your search.  
*Searching: "Ruby Object Orientation CLI"  is much more effective and efficient than "How to use Object Orientation concept in Ruby for developing CLI application" 

Check the date! Check the date! Check the date!  Technology is always changing and adapting.  If you find an article that is directly solving your problem, everything seems great and dandy.. But it's still not working... Could be just because the article is from 3 years ago.. and is no longer relevent.  Oops.. Time to move on, and next time check the date sooner.

Always include the languages that you are using. Just at the end add a little 'Ruby' 'js' 'html' ect.  Some helpful thing may actually not be useful for your particular language.

You can use quotes to find and exact phrase. For example, *ruby concept "object orientation"*

Using 'vs' to compare things will help your search phrases to be more concise.
*Searching "What is the difference between CRUD and Restful routes in Ruby" is less efficient than "CRUD vs Restful Routes ruby"*

To find word definitions quickly use "define:"  For Example, "define:interpolation ruby"  

Search within a website by typing "site:" followed by the site URL and your search keywords. 
*For example, “site:github.com requests” will search for requests on github only. Extremely helpful to search on websites that do not have search capability.*

"intitle:" will only retrieve pages with your keywords in the title.  This is useful when searching for articles or blog pages.

Use Google Advance Book Search or Google Scholar when your looking for technical publications. It also gives you an ability to easily cite the source.

You can find sites similar to certain website by using “related:”

Implement the "10 Tab Rule" to find many different results.  More on that below!


**3.  Choose your results

Learn to scan! Training yourself to quickly read through and article or document is an invalueable asset.  

You should scan through a document and quickly decide if it is directly useful or not. If not then delete the tab and move on until you find the information that you're looking for.

After you find something that you're interested in, this is when you take the time to read and understand what it's saying or teaching you.  If you're missing a concept in understanding the article, then go back to google and search more about that concept.  Once you understand the concept, then go back to your first article and reread it.  Then apply your new knowledge to your project! 

Repeating all these steps should result in a successful problem solver, and will set you up with successful habits as a student and valuable future employee.  

Turns out that huge scary sea monster is quite friendly, and Nessie only wanted to help you reach your goal at the other side of the deep sea.. We just needed to accept the help to begin with and learn how to use it.


## The 10 Tab Rule by Ken Mazaika -- My new golden rule.##

The biggest problem that new programmers face is that they don't have enough knowledge about programming or errors under their belt to simply know what to search for.

the 10 tab rule is a simple way for people to search something and open pages that they wouldn't necessarily think to read to begin with.  Especially when the summary sentence includes terminology you may or may not even know..

**What is the 10 tab rule?  This process should take you around 10-15 mins**.

* Take a minute to really think about your problem to search for it in a concise way.  (The methods above will be a life saver for this!)
* Make your google search!  Open the first 10 results of your search, each in it's own tab.
* Spend a minute or so scanning the page for relevant ideas that could help you solve your problem.  
* Delete irrelevant tabs as you go.

The idea of this process is to show new programmers what are common key words that appear on articles when you make a google search.  It is exposing you to new terminology that could be relevant to you, but you previously were unaware of.  

It will also expose you to reoccurring web pages that could be indisposbale for you in your career.  Possibly blogs, online communities, certain authors.  Then that will help your searches become more narrow in the long term.  The idea is that you will start with 10 tabs, and eventually it will become 3-4 tabs over time, but you won't be scared to fill up your tabs bar completely if necessary.
