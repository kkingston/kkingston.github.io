I've learned that making lists and outlines is so incredibly important when your starting any project.

Climbing Routes and Reviews.  Those were my two main models that I would use for my project.

There was a point during project mode that I realized everything was a tangled mess and I needed to sort out all my routes and really figure out where everything needed to go.

So, I made a flow chart!

I will admit, I did change some things.  But I was able to see very clearly how my models/controllers/views would interact with each other.

I color coded each controller, so I could visualize each one.

You can even see how I started to think about my nested route there in the middle with the orange and green.  Later I ended up changing these routes and restructuring it, but with this visual that was made so much easier for me.


My next epiphany was about something as simple as a todo list.  I am a very distracted person.  I tend to jump from one thing to the next without finishing anything.  There was a point when I had so many different broken things in my code that I was backed up into a corner, and I was no longer able to move forward.  I was so lost, that I needed to ditch everything and just start fresh.

I created that flow chart above, and opened my notebook and started an ongoing to-do list.

This page needed to be kept open at all times.  When I would stop one thing to start another, I would write down that problem.  Then when I encounter another problem that Iâ€™m stuck on, instead of starting something new again I can rotate back onto older problems.  Sometimes one broken thing is only broken because of another thing on that list. Then all of a sudden you can knock two things off because you can actually see all the things written down.  

This process simply adds another level of depth to your problem solving and is an invaluable tool to add to your coding toolbox.
